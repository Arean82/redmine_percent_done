The Redmine Issue Done Ratio Plugin  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jkraemer/redmine_percent_done.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jkraemer/redmine_percent_done)
===================================

This plugin allows to enforce a certain setting for the `done_ratio` issue
field for just some Issue statuses, while keeping the ability to manually set
the done ratio.

For example, new issues can default to 0%, resolved issues get 100%, but while
working on an issue, the assignee may freely change the done ratio to reflect
actual progress.
